# stock-analysis
 VBA of Wall Street
# Challenge

In this challenge we analyse some stocks using VBA. We refactor our previous codes and one outer loop and three nested loops in order to loop through the stock original data and create a tab with the ticker names, their total Daily Volumes and their returns. 

 Our code does: 
 *Create arrays and integrer
 *get the number of rows to loop over
 *get ticker name and start price for each tickerIndex and store them in arrays
 *get the tolalVolume
 *get ending price price in array as well as increment tickerIndex for next loop
 *add all the information on a worksheet
 *format the tab created
